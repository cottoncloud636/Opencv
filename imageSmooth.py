"""
1) Filter sigma: it's the standard deviation used in Gaussian-based filtering methods. It determines the extent to 
   which the filter smooths the image by affecting how much influence neighboring pixels have on the computation of 
   the new pixel value.

2) 5: The diameter of each pixel neighborhood used during filtering. The larger the diameter, the more pixels around 
each pixel are used to compute the result.

3) 15 (sigmaColor): This is the filter sigma in the color space. A larger value means that farther colors within the
   pixel neighborhood will be mixed together, resulting in larger areas of semi-equal color.

4) 15 (sigmaSpace): This is the filter sigma in the coordinate space. A larger value means that farther pixels will 
   influence each other as long as their colors are close enough (as determined by sigmaColor).
