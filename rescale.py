    1)    The shape attribute comes from NumPy, as OpenCV uses NumPy arrays to represent images and frames. When read 
    an image or a video frame using OpenCV, it is stored as a NumPy array. The shape attribute of a NumPy array 
    provides the dimensions of the array.
        For an image (or a video frame), which is typically a 3D array, shape returns a tuple of the form (height, width,
    channels):
              height: The number of rows (pixels) in the image.
              width: The number of columns (pixels) in the image.
              channels: The number of color channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images).
